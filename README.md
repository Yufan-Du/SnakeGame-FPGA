# SnakeGame-FPGA
PKU Digital Circuit Experimental Class final project. It(掌控贪吃蛇) is a gesture-controlled game. Capture player's hand movements through a camera to achieve real-time control of game characters.
This approach abandons traditional button or touch screen operation methods, allowing players to explore the classic game Snake more freely and interestingly.
BTW, this game is written in the 2022 version of VIVADO and is suitable for Xilinx Artix-7 Basys 3 FPGA. Different versions may cause IP core compatibility issues.
